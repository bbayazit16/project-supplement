/**
 * Optimism class calculates savings for Optimism.
 *
 * ======== Methodology ========
 *
 * Optimism is an optimistic rollup that is EVM equivalent, hence each L2 gas is equivalent
 * to an L1 gas.
 *
 * Since the Etherscan API does not return fees paid for a transaction, it
 * has to be calculated manually. Fees paid can be calculated using the following
 * formula:
 *
 * (L2GasUsed * L2GasPrice) + (L1GasUsed * L1GasPrice * feeScalar)
 * where
 * L2GasUsed: The amount of gas used by the transaction
 * L2GasPrice: The price of one unit of gas on Optimism in wei
 * L1GasUsed: The amount of L1 gas used by the transaction
 * L1GasPrice: The price of one unit of gas on L1 in wei, set automatically
 * by the OVM Gas Price Oracle as the gas price on L1 varies
 * feeScalar: a constant set by the L2 owner, that is rarely changed.
 *
 * Index 2071713: Fee scalar reduced from 1.5 to 1.24 @see https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/2071713
 * Index 5368652: Fee scalar reduced from 1.24 to 1.00 @see https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/5368652
 *
 *
 * L1GasUsed is straightforward to calculate. For each unit of rlp encoded transaction, zero bytes cost
 * 4 gas while non-zero bytes cost 16 gas. Overhead cost and 68 bytes of padding are added,
 * where
 * padding is 68 * 16, added for the lack of signature on transaction
 * overhead is the per batch gas overhead of posting both transaction and state roots to
 * L1 given larger batch sizes, a constant controlled by the chain owner that is rarely
 * changed.
 *
 * Index 2071714: Overhead reduced from 2750 to 2100 @see https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/2071714
 *
 * @see https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F#code
 *
 *
 * The method eth_getTransactionReceipt on Optimism JSON RPC returns l1fee, which is equal
 * to l1GasUsed * l1GasPrice * l1FeeScalar. All that needs to be done is to add l2fee to l1fee
 * to retreive total fee paid, where l2fee = (L2GasUsed * L2GasPrice).
 *
 * Finally, because each unit of L1 gas is equal to L2 gas, gasUsed * l1gasPrice retuns the
 * amount of fee that would be spent if the transaction was sent on L1 at the exact same date.
