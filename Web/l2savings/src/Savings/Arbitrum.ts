/**
 * Arbitrum class calculates savings for Arbitrum.
 *
 * ======== Methodology ========
 *
 * Arbitrum savings are only calculated for transactions after Arbitrum Nitro. This is because AVM had different
 * gas costs for each instruction compared to the EVM.
 *
 * Arbgas concept was removed with Arbitrum Nitro.
 * @see https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/migration/dapp_migration.md#cool-new-stuff
 *
 * So,
 *
 * L2Gas = gasUsed
 * L2Fee = L2Gas * effectiveGasPrice
 *
 * Gas if transaction was on L1:
 * L1Gas = L2Gas - gasUsedForL1, because L2Gas includes L1 calldata gas.
 *
 * L1Fees are calculated according to dmihal/ethereum-average-fees subgraph.
 *
