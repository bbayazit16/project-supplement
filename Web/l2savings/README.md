# L2Savings

_How much fees have you saved by using Ethereum L2's?_

See how much fees Îž$ you saved on [l2savings.org](https://www.l2savings.org)!

## Motivation

Ethereum Layer 2 solutions offer near-instant confirmations, Ethereum-level security and decentralization, and near-infinite scalability. They are one of the most convenient ways of solving the [blockchain trilemma](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html), along with [sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/). However Ethereum Layer 2's often lack marketing and incentives to push developers to deploy their applications on them. L2Savings aims to show how much anyone has saved by using Ethereum L2's compared to if their transactions were sent on Ethereum Mainnet.

## Data Provided

Following data is provided for every supported chain:

- Transaction Count On L2
- Gas Spent on L2 (Converted To Mainnet Gas If Applicable)
- Chain-Native Gas Spent (eg. arbgas)
- L2 Fees Paid in Ether
- L2 Fees Paid in USD (according to Ether's current value)
- L1 Fees Paid in Ether (If L2 transactions were sent on L1)
- L1 Fees Paid in USD
- Fees Saved in Ether and USD
- Times cheaper (Fee If On L1 / L2 Fee paid)

## How Savings Are Calculated

Simply put,

Fees if the transaction was sent on L1 at the same day with exactly the same gas - Actual fees paid for transaction on L2

### Optimism

For EVM equivalent L2's such as [Optimism](https://optimism.io/), it is easy to calculate the equivalent L1 cost, because the concept of gas is same on the L2. (L2 Gas \* Mainnet gas price at the time of transaction).

The formula for Optimism Transaction fee is (Gas Price _Gas) + (L1 Gas Used_ L1 Fee Scalar \* L1 Gas Price).
Optimistic Etherscan doesn't provide the transaction fee in their API, let alone the L1 Fee Scalar, L1 Gas Price and L1 Gas used. Due to this reason the L1 gas price and overhead is extracted from eth_getTransactionReceipt calls to an Optimism RPC.

For more info, see [the FAQ](https://l2savings.org/faq)

### Arbitrum

[Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) is not EVM equivalent, but EVM compatible. Due to it's design, the Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM) require(d) [a different approach to gas](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas). Each unit used to be referred to as "arbgas". However, with the Nitro upgrade, L2 instruction costs are now equivalavent to L1 instruction costs. L2Savings only supports transactions after the Arbitrum Nitro upgrade.

L2Gas includes both the L2 computation cost and the L1 calldata gas cost. So:

L1Gas = L2Gas - gasUsedForL1

Similar to Optimism, all values can be found in the eth_getTransactionReceipt method. Later, L1Gas is multipled with average daily L1 gas price at the day of the transaction.

## ZkSync

[ZkSync](https://zksync.io/) is a [ZK (Zero Knowledge) Rollup](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/) which is an L2 much cheaper than Optimistic Rollups.

> Two rollups walk into a bar. The barman asks: "Can I see your ids?". ZK Rollup says: "I can prove to you I'm over 18, but I won't show you my id". Optimistic Rollup says: "If nobody can prove I'm underage in 7 days that means I'm over 18" [Source](https://twitter.com/l2beatcom/status/1448556881686024192)

 However ZkSync is not EVM equivalent, making it harder to predict equivalent L1 gas cost of operations. ZkSync has "types" of transactions, which are ChangePubKey, Transfer, Swap, Withdraw, ForcedExit, MintNFT and WithdrawNFT. The L2 <--> L1 gas is estimate is thus done by using the average costs for each operation on Ethereum L1. Which means Ether transfers are considered as 21000 gas, token transfers 65000, swaps 160000 and NFT Mints 150000. ZkSync also allows users to pay with different tokens, such as stablecoins, which requires the conversion of fees paid into ether with the price rate during the time of transaction.
